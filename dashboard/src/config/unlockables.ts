/**
 * Defines a feature that requires a milestone to be unlocked.
 *
 * Features are automatically locked in navigation and on their respective pages
 * until the specified milestone is purchased in-game. The system uses SSE events
 * to update lock status in real-time.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Adding a new lockable feature:
 * {
 *   route: '/vehicles',
 *   milestoneName: 'Automated Vehicles',
 *   tier: 4,
 *   displayName: 'Vehicles',
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @property route - Must match the page route exactly (e.g., "/trains", "/drones").
 *   This is used to identify which navigation item and page to lock.
 * @property milestoneName - Must match the exact milestone name from the FRM API
 *   schematics data. Case-sensitive. If no match is found, the feature will be
 *   treated as unlocked with a console warning.
 * @property tier - The milestone tier number for display purposes only. Shown on
 *   the locked page UI as "(Tier X)".
 * @property displayName - Human-readable name shown in the locked page UI and
 *   tooltips.
